# Forecasting_time_series_2:
In the chapter 1 - "**Forecasting_time_series**", I introduced about the definition of time series, about a lot of forecasting approaches to deal with planning tasks. Our aim is analyzing multivariate time series allows you to examine the relationships and interactions between different variables over time.

# Univariate and multivariate models:
We had learned about ARIMA, SARIMA,... belongs to the class of univariate model. So now we will move to the class of multivariate time series and how to model it in R.
## Definitions:
Multivariate time series refers to a type of data where multiple variables are observed and recorded over time. Unlike a univariate time series, which involves a single variable measured sequentially over time, a multivariate time series consists of several variables, each tracked over the same time period.
## How to model:
Here are some common models and techniques used for multivariate time series analysis:

# In R:
In this chapter, I will present the tutorial of time series forecasting by package {h2o} and the combination between packages {timetk} and {recipe}.

# Conclusion:
I hope you can enjoy the pratice and hope you have a great day!!! See you soon in another future topic.
